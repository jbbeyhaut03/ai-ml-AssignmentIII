## Dataset

The dataset used for this project is not included in the repository due to size limitations. 

To run the code, please follow these steps:
1. Download the dataset from the following link: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1DuOq97EKyVpDm3SGUiPxHNhC7IxdvwSs
2. Place the downloaded file (`goodreads_reviews_spoiler.json.gz`) in the `data/` folder within the repository.

The folder structure should look like this:
your-repo/
│
├── data/                   
│   └── goodreads_reviews_spoiler.json.gz  # The dataset file (not in the repo)
│
├── code/                  
│   └── jypiter notebook     
│
├── .gitignore             
├── README.md  


Once the dataset is placed correctly, you can run the code without any issues.
